# Leading Cause of Death in New York City and Los Angeles in 2019

This project aimed to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize government data obtained for New York City and Los Angeles to understand the leading causes of death in cities with similar social and political environments in 2019, before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alongside a team, I performed several analyses using Excel and Tableau to import, clean, and graph the data. With the information gained from our discoveries, my colleagues and I concluded that many of the leading causes of death were medical-related. As a result, we recommended healthy habits and actionable next steps to stakeholders that can improve their well-being and quality of life.
