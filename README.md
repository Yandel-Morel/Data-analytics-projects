# Creme and Cocoa Creamery Presentation

This project aimed to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize customer data from Creme and Cocoa Creamery, a Black-owned business 
based in New York City. The goal was to understand the company's client engagement history via their online platforms in order 
to expand their audience.

Alongside a team, I performed several analyses using Excel to import, clean, and graph the data. With the information gained 
from our discoveries, my colleagues and I concluded that the business experienced high social media engagement when they nurtured their 
online and community presence.

As a result, we recommended several specific actionable next steps to strengthen their relationship with their current audience base, attract new
customers, and foster organic growth.
