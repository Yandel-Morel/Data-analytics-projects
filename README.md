# Data-analytics-projects
This is my digital portfolio of projects where I utilize my technical skills and go through the data analysis process.

This project aims to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize FitBit data obtained from Kaggle, and information obtained
from Verto Analytics, in order to understand how consumers utilize their smart devices. 

Bellabeat is a wellness company with smart devices that monitor several aspects of women's health, and are seeking to
gain more customers.

With the information gained from my analysis, insights and conclusions will be derived to create suggestions and actionable 
next steps that can be applied to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
