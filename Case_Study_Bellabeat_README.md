# Case Study: Bellabeat

The purpose of this project was to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize FitBit data obtained from Kaggle, and information obtained
from Verto Analytics, in order to understand how consumers utilize their smart devices. 

The stakeholder of interest is Bellabeat, a wellness company with smart devices that monitor several aspects of women's health, who were seeking to
gain more customers and expand their brand.

I performed an analysis using RStudio to import, clean, and graph the data. With the information gained from my analysis, I derived insights and conclusions to create suggestions and actionable next steps that can be applied to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
