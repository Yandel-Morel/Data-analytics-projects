        "# Python 105: Data Analytics Salary Analysis\n",
        " _Author: Martin Arroyo_\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scenario\n",
        "You are an analyst working on a new data set that your company acquired for research purposes. It contains salary information for data analytics professionals collected between 2020 and 2022. \n",
        "\n",
        "Management has asked you to do an exploratory analysis of this new data. [Click here to read the email they sent you.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-3SG76KQxj-aeKQ6-ZmRuntsAdoPqC8lMtQPzuhVJQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part One\n",
        "Clean the `ds_salaries` table using the outline provided below. Use documentation to refresh your memory on syntax. After you're done cleaning, your data should have no null values and no duplicates.\n",
        "### Part Two\n",
        "Complete the analysis using everything we've learned so far in Python 101-104. Ensure that the data is clean, then answer the questions in the code cells under **Part Two**. Use a combination of visuals, tabular data, and written language to answer the questions. **Create at least 3 visuals**.\n",
        "### Part Three\n",
        "After you're done, write a response to your manager's email letting them know that you have completed your assignment. Share any additional insights or findings you may have found in the data, along with: \n",
        "\n",
        "- a copy of your notebook with your code and visuals\n",
        "- the `ds_salaries_clean` table as a `csv` file\n",
        "\n",
        "This should be a professional email response. In this scenario, your pod captain will play the role of manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "<hr />\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "### Using Python + SQL\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we are connected to a database, you can use a combination of `SQL` and `Python` to answer your questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To query the database directly, you can use the `%%sql` cell magic at the top of a cell, then write your query below like this:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "%%sql\n",
        "\n",
        "SELECT * FROM ds_salaries;\n",
        "``` \n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have the results you like, copy and paste the query into a `string`, then get your result as a `DataFrame` using `read_sql`:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "query = \"SELECT * FROM ds_salaries\"\n",
        "my_query_df = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n",
        "```\n",
        "*Note: If you're using the `%%sql` cell magic, the connection to the database will sometimes drop, giving an error. This is expected. Just run the same cell again and your query should execute.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Keep in Mind\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not a client project, nor will this be part of a presentation. It should be neat, but any visuals you make do not need to be fancy. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "If you get stuck, first do a search for the problem you're trying to solve. More often than not, someone else has encountered a similar issue and you'll be able to find a relatively clear answer. You can also check the documentation of the program you're using. If you find yourself getting frustrated, stop and take a short break. If all else fails, then reach out to another person for help.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Troubleshooting\n",
        "\n",
        "There may be things here that you don't remember how to do, or maybe there is something you want to do that we haven't covered. Use the resources provided to you in Slack and from the other Python nights, the Python 101-104 notebooks, as well as whatever you can find on the internet to help you. \n",
        "\n",
